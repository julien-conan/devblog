## Roadmap
I am maintaining the website and will make the effort to relate all interesting stuff I have learned from my profesionnel experiences in development. Since it has been more than eight years, I still have many articles to write. 2021 will be the year for this challenge. You will be able to follow my progression on the Github participation graph more or less. I will try to keep changes posted here : [Github Project](https://github.com/julien-conan/devblog/projects/1), even though most changes are instantaious.
First things first, after continuous articles flow will be the time to continue the feature about Disqus in order to give you some freedom of speech, and better interaction. 
Thank you for your time ! You can buy me a coffee at : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jconan
