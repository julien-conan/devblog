Configuring Windows to execute Linux command, and merging frames in Visual Studio Code makes the bridge between those two. Thank you Microsoft for your last actions towards community developers. Open-source softwares will win, at the very end.</p>\n<h2>Frameworks</h2>\n<div class=\"custom-images\" style=\"width: 400px; margin: auto;\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/2018-12-09-road-map-brainstorming.png\">\n</div>\n<p>I currently enjoy front development libraries based on Javascript like <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>. Deployment from <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">Npm</a> is like having a terminal copilot which does the main part of the job for you. It takes a few time to obtain a stable environment but it really worth the time !</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<div class=\"custom-images\" style=\"width: 500px; margin: auto;\">\n\t<img src=\"/assets/2018-12-09-road-map-personal-contributions.png\">\n</div>\n<br/>\n<p>This end of the year has been an exciting field of research around web technologies. My personal main target looking at my contributions is to reach the most linear production as possible, that is to say to enhance predictibility and velocity over incoming year and to improve techniques acquisitions through code writing of course, but also through professional meetings and events where developers and managers shares tips and good practices in order to build faster and better softwares.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 09, 2018","path":"/road-map","title":"Road map","thumbnail":"/assets/2018-12-09-road-map.jpg","metaDescription":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
