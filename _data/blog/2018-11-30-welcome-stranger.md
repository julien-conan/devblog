# Welcome

Welcome to my blog, I hope you will enjoy your little tour. Decrease ambient lights, fasten your seatbelts, and enjoy following the leader inside front, back, statistics, and creative coding.

## Who am I?

First of all, I am a french engineer dedicated to software programming since 2012. I started professional (recreative) coding in research laboratories, with aeronautics and military customers focused on interfaces ergonomics, analysis, and design. I developed features and softwares through off-the-shelves methodologies, both on new and old devices. I worked in creative environment like live performances, kids workshops, virtual and augmented reality for industrial customers too.

## Is this magic?

You may ask yourself, how this guy could write a blog in full .js  starting in 2012, even since Gatsby framework wasn't created yet. In fact, I started writing those articles in 2018, then I thought about how I became a software developer, a question asked by a lot of beginners nowadays. My story started a long time ago, and I take advantage of this exercice to remember myself how I have been through and share my experiences here with you. Time doesn't matter, if you can control it. Have a nice visit!
