# Welcome

Welcome to my blog, I hope you will enjoy your little tour. Decrease ambient lights, fasten your seatbelts, and enjoy following the leader inside front, back, statistics, and creative coding.

## Who am I ?

First of all, I am a french engineer dedicated to software programming since 2012. I started professional (recreative) coding in research laboratories, with aeronautics and military customers focused on interfaces ergonomics, analysis, and design. I developed features and softwares through off-the-shelves methodologies, both on new and old devices. I worked in creative environment like live performances, kids workshops, virtual and augmented reality for industrial customers too.
