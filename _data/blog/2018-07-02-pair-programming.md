metaDescription: How to create pairs programming, benefits and challenges

As many people know, pair programming tend to be a good practice. However, it is not so often that it is actually used by every programmer. There is a lot of one-member team, also a misunderstanding or a undervalue commitment on this topic in a lot of industries (like TDD you can assume). Come on, you know this is not right. Take the basis, and share this habit with your team and/or your friends.

Pair programming is like buying new shoes. First, you hesitate. You don't know where to find the good ones. Until you find them. Then you ask yourselves how you were able to live without them.
