    "description": "Welcome to my blog. I am a fullstack dev-explorer since 2012, in France. I am a self-made man since 2015, that is to say I develop and share programming knowledge on my own account with various technologies. Consultant since 2019, I had the luck to work with little, medium and large companies. Let's have a talk about your project(s) !"
