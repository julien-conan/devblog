    "description": "I have been a software engineer since 2012. As a consultant since 2019, I have had the opportunity to work in small, medium and large companies with a staff ranging from a few individuals to several dozen. I love learning, discovering and mastering different tools and methodologies aimed at improving production as a whole. Passionate about software factories and driven by DevOps automatisation values, I tend to focus on cultivating a group social capital while maintaining a growth and continuous improvement mindset. You can meet me at trade shows or meetups dedicated to architecture, security and sharing good development practices."
