    "description": "Welcome to my blog. I have been a software engineer since 2012. As a consultant since 2019, I have had the opportunity to work in small, medium and large companies with a staff ranging from a few individuals to several dozen. I love learning, discovering and mastering different tools and methodologies aimed at improving production as a whole. Passionate about software forges and driven by the values of agile development and devops, I focus on developing the social capital of a group while maintaining a growth mindset and continuous improvement. You can meet me at trade shows or meetups dedicated to architecture, security and sharing good practices in Paris, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Biarritz. Let's have a talk about your projects, or share a coffee on [Skype](https://join.skype.com/invite/dM7CIcElzXZB) or Twitch."
