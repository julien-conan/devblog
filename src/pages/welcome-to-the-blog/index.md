## Who am I ?

French generalist engineer, dedicated to software programming since 2012. I started professional coding in a research laboratory environement, where aeronautics or military customers where focus on system ergonomics analysis, and developing innovative features through off-the-shelves methods or absolutely new devices. Among others, I also worked in more creative environment like dance performances, and kids workshop around virtual and augmented reality too.
